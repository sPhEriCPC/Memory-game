copied the pseudocode form the doc 

Packages to import:
	Java.util.Random;
	Java.io.BufferedWriter;
	Java.io.FileWriter;



Create object with attributes score, number to guess, current guess, level

// method for a random number generator 
Have # of digits as parameter 
Number to guess= random digit between 1 and 9
For loop (repeat once per level)
		Number to guess= number to guess*10 // will push the random digit back 1 place 
		Number to guess= number to guess + random digit between 0 and 9


// when the “new number” button is pressed 
	Generate a new random number
	Store that number as the number to guess attribute of the object 
	Set number label to the random number
	Set a timer for 1 second (maybe longer?) 
	Set number label to null after timer 


// when “go button” is pressed 
	Take user input from text box and convert to int 
	Store that int as the guess attribute of the object
	Check if the guess and the number to guess are equal 
	If correct 
		Add 1 to score and level 
	If incorrect 
		End game
		Send user to the end of game screen

** use the same file writer stuff as the login project
